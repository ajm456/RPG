OVERVIEW:
- Plot summary
	- Story about a young man and his companion fighting against a religious
		conspiracy way beyond them:
		- In a heavily monoreligious state, a legend promises that their god
			will one day come down to rule over them in person eternally.
		- This occurs shortly after the game begins; however, this is not the
			promised god, but a demon in human form co-operating with the state
			government.
		- The demon's goal is to bring satisfaction and peace to all the people
			of the nation such that he can draw upon their souls' energies (a 
			magic essence called "Calm") to empower himself in his fight for
			supremacy over hell.
		- The antithesis to Calm is a primal energy called "Discord", a
			manifestation of one's raw emotional state; chaos, pain, and
			disorder usually generate powerful emotions such as anger and
			despair, and it's possible to learn how to manipulate Discord to
			perform normally superhuman actions.
		- At face value, it seems clear that a demon should not be able to
			exploit the population of an entire nation for his personal gain.
			However, it is not black and white; many would argue that a state
			of high Calm is positive, whereas high Discord is negative. For
			example, unchecked Discord causes riots and crime; the state
			obviously doesn't want this, hence their agreeing to the demon's
			plan. Those who are against the demon's plan have a fundamental
			belief that nothing should manipulate their emotional state for any
			kind of personal gain.
		- The protagonist's primary companion throughout the game - Jack - is,
			in fact, the promised god, but he is far from what both the player
			and the game characters expect; years of dogma have malformed the
			true meaning and purpose behind the religion. He also keeps his
			true identity hidden until very late in the game, as his goal is to
			secretly accompany the protagonist to learn what his people have
			become.
		

CHARACTERS:
- (Unnamed protagonist)
	- Typical JRPG protagonist; primarily a medium for the player to relate to
		the story.
	- Silent, but not expressionless - think Joker from Persona 5.
- Jack
	- Bishounen-like; kind and light-hearted, but serious when he needs to be.
	- Almost always positive; any times his outlook turns negative should have
		*very* serious implications.





















COMBAT:
	
- Resource(s)
	- Two resources: Discord and Calm
		- They are not "spent" like mana, but instead enhance your chosen
			ability. For example, an attack with high Discord does a lot more
			damage than one with low.
		- Generally, abilities that benefit from a resource increase it, i.e.
			attacks increase Discord, and (also generally) decrease their
			counterpart resource.
			- This encourages planning ahead; you can win battles much faster
				if your whole party focuses on Discord, but you may find
				yourself lacking in defensive tools (and thus dying).
			- Notably, the protagonist is an exception to this rule due to his
				passive.
		- Stronger abilities do cost resources, but do not consume them.
			

- Stats
	- Pretty standard stuff
	- STRENGTH
		- Directly correlates with damage dealt by attacks
		- Formula for attack:
			- 2.5*strength < damage < 3.5*strength
	- STAMINA
		- Increases max HP
	- AGILITY
		- Increases chance of critical strikes
			- Critical strikes are (without improvements) 2x damage
		- Formula for chance of a crit:
			- % chance = 3 + 0.3*agility
	- TRUST
		- Increases the effectiveness of augments both on allies' attacks
			- Each augment benefits from trust in a unique way
	- PASSION <placeholder name>
		- Increases the effectiveness of discord abilities
			- Each aura benefits from discord in a unique way (if at all)
	- WISDOM <placeholder name>
		- Increases the effectiveness of calm abilities
			- Each aura benefits from calm in a unique way (if at all)

- Abilities
	- Each character has a unique passive
		- Marl: Discord and Calm increases do not decrease each other
		- Jack: While below %x Discord, he gains access to unique Calm spells <this might suck>
		- Eris: <????>

- Battle mechanics
	- Attacks can be AUGMENTED by allies
		- Augments are trained separately to abilities (i.e. players can choose to
			specialise in abilities or augments, or be generalist in both)
		- Augments do not cost resources but do consume the augmenter's turn
		- By comboing an ability with a specific augment, bonus effects occur
			- E.g: augment an attack with a fire-element to "melt armor"
		- This should NOT feel like Rikku-esque "discover recipes"
			- Augments primary gameplay purpose are to speed up player turns
				instead of just mashing attack with each ally
	- The faster the player completes their turn...
		- ??? Reduced Discord / Calm cost ???
