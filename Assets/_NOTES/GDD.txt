COMBAT:
	
- Resource(s)
	- Two resources: Discord and Calm
		- Discord is spent on damaging abilities; Calm on buffs and heals
		- Generally, increasing one decreases the other
			- Marl is an exception to this due to his passive
		- 

- Stats

- Abilities
	- Each character has a unique passive
		- Marl: Discord and Calm increases do not decrease each other
		- Jack: While below %x Discord, he gains access to unique Calm spells

- Battle mechanics
	- Attacks can be AUGMENTED by allies
		- Augments are trained separately to abilities (i.e. players can choose to specialise in abilities or augments, or be generalist in both)
		- Augments do not cost resources but do consume the augmenter's turn
		- By comboing an ability with a specific augment, bonus effects occur
			- E.g: augment an attack with a fire-element to "melt armor"
		- This should NOT feel like Rikku-esque "discover recipes"
			- Augments primary gameplay purpose are to speed up player turns instead of just mashing attack with each ally
	- The faster the player completes their turn...
		- ??? Reduced Discord / Calm cost ???
