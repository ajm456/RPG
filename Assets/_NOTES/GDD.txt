OVERVIEW:
- Plot summary
	- Story about a young man and his companion fighting against a religious
		conspiracy way beyond them:
		- In a heavily monoreligious state, a legend promises that their god
			will one day come down to rule over them in person eternally.
		- This occurs shortly after the game begins; however, this is not the
			promised god, but a demon in human form co-operating with the state
			government.
		- The demon's goal is to bring satisfaction and peace to all the people
			of the nation such that he can draw upon their souls' energies (a 
			magic essence called "Calm") to empower himself in his fight for
			supremacy over hell.
		- The antithesis to Calm is a primal energy called "Strife", a
			manifestation of one's raw emotional state; chaos, pain, and
			disorder usually generate powerful emotions such as anger and
			despair, and it's possible to learn how to manipulate Strife to
			perform normally superhuman actions (although kept secret from all
			except the state's closest agents).
		- At face value, it seems clear that a demon should not be allowed to
			exploit the population of an entire nation for his personal gain; he
			is the villain, so to speak. However, it is not black and white;
			many would argue that a state of high Calm is positive, whereas
			high Strife is negative. For example, unchecked Strife causes riots
			and crime; the state obviously doesn't want this, hence their agreeing
			to the demon's plan. Those who are against the demon's plan have a
			fundamental belief that nothing should manipulate their emotional
			state for any kind of personal gain.
		- The protagonist's primary companion throughout the game - Jack - is,
			in fact, the promised god, but he is far from what both the player
			and the game characters expect; years of dogma have malformed the
			true meaning and purpose behind the religion. He also keeps his
			true identity hidden until very late in the game, as his goal is to
			secretly accompany the protagonist to learn what his people have
			become.
		

CHARACTERS:
- (Unnamed protagonist)
	- Typical JRPG protagonist; primarily a medium for the player to relate to
		the story.
	- Silent, but not expressionless - think Joker from Persona 5.
- Jack
	- Bishounen-like; kind and light-hearted, but serious when he needs to be.
	- Almost always positive; any times his outlook turns negative should have
		*very* serious implications.
- Elise
	- Ara ara gamedev-kun





















COMBAT:
	
- Resource(s)
	- Two resources: Strife and Calm
		- They are not "spent" like mana, but instead enhance your chosen
			ability. For example, performing an attack when you have with high
			Strife does a lot more damage than when you have low Strife.
		- There is a general and intuitive rule that Strife-based abilities are
			destructive and Calm-based ones restorative / supportive.
		- Generally, abilities that benefit from a resource increase it, i.e.
			attacks increase Strife, and (also generally) decrease their
			counterpart resource.
			- This encourages planning ahead; you can win battles much faster
				if your whole party focuses on Strife, but you may find
				yourself lacking in defensive tools (and thus dying).
			- Notably, the protagonist is an exception to this rule due to his
				passive.
		- Stronger abilities do cost resources, but do not consume them.
			

- Stats
	- Pretty standard stuff
	- POWER
		- Directly correlates with damage dealt by attacks
		- Formula for attack:
			- 2.5*power < damage < 3.5*power
		- Damaging abilities also uniquely scale with power
	- STAMINA
		- Increases max HP
	- AGILITY
		- Increases chance of critical strikes
			- Critical strikes are (without improvements) 2x damage
			- Formula for chance of a crit:
				- % chance = 3 + 0.3*agility
		- Increases how frequently the character gets to take a turn
	- TRUST
		- Increases the effectiveness of augments both on allies' attacks
			- Each augment benefits from trust in a unique way


- Turn order
	Order by agility descending, dividing by two until < lowest agility (even if
	original lowest agility combatant is dead)

	Opposing factions with the same agility are resolved favouring the player
	Same factions with the same agility are resolved predictably (not yet decided how)

	Jack	Marl	Eris	Frog1	Frog2
	16		14		26		11		8

	Eris	(26 -> 13)
	Jack	(16 -> 8)
	Marl	(14 -> 7)
	Eris	(13 -> 6.5)
	Frog1	(11 -> 5.5)
	Jack	(8 -> 4)
	Frog2	(8 -> 4)

	This queue repeats itself until a) the battle ends, b) a combatant dies, or c) a combatant(s)'s agility changes

	a) Obviously no more turns are taken
	b) That character is immediately removed from the queue
	c) Recalculate from the character whose turn it is
		 i) The stat adjustment is divided by 2^(turns started in this queue iteration)
		ii) Future queue calculations include this adjusted speed

	EXAMPLE: Marl increases agility by +5 on his turn

	He's started one turn so increase becomes +5/2 = +2.5 = 9.5
	This is above the round's lowest agility stat so he gets another turn - recalculate the list to discern where

	<Eris>	already taken
	<Jack>	already taken
	<Marl>	already taken, his own turn
	Eris	(13)
	Frog1	(11)
	Jack	(8!)

	Marl's extra turn goes between Frog1 and Jack




- Character traits
	- Each character has a unique passive
		- Marl: Strife and Calm increases do not decrease each other
			- Marl should be the only character to feel 100% specializable by the player. You
				can make him a physical attacker, a supporter, an augmenter, or any mix of the
				three. This is *NOT* the case with other characters, where their obvious progression
				route reflects their character (i.e. Jack is very much a Calm specialist).
		- Jack: While below %x Strife, he gains access to unique Calm spells <this might be too limiting?>
		- Eris: ara ara gamedev-kun




- Effects
	- An effect is a direct stat modifier
		- For example, -5 HP (attacking can be thought of as applying an effect)
	- ??? Scale with a stat ???

- Auras
	- Repeatedly either cause or maintain an effect on a combatant
		- For example, -10 HP per turn for 4 turns
	- Abilities apply 0 or more auras on their target(s)
	- Auras are resolved at the start of the affected combatant's turn
	- REPRESENTED AS:
		- A list of effects and a counter
			- Each effect in the list details what happens on that turn (relative to when the aura was applied)
			- e.g.: a damage-over-time would look like {hp -= 2, hp -= 2, hp -= 2}
			- e.g.: a strength debuff would like like {str -= 3, null, null, str += 3}

- Abilities
	- The primary combat turn-taking alternative to simple attacking
	- Combination of one or more effects (applied instantly) and zero or more auras (applied from the target's next turn)
	- For example:
		- Fireball
			INSTANT EFFECT: {hp -= 10}
			AURA = {hp -= 2, hp -= 2, hp -= 2}
		- Frostbolt
			INSTANT EFFECTS: {hp -= 7, agi -= 5}
			AURA = {null, null, null, agi += 5}
		- Slow
			INSTANT EFFECT: {agi -= 8}
			AURA = {null, null, null, agi += 8}








- Augments
	- Attacks can be AUGMENTED by allies
		- Augments are trained separately to abilities (i.e. players can choose to
			specialise in abilities or augments, or be generalist in both)
		- Augments do not cost resources but do consume the augmenter's next turn
		- By comboing an ability with a specific augment, bonus effects occur
			- E.g: augment an attack with a fire-element to "melt armor"
		- This should NOT feel like an encyclopedia of augment + ability combinations to trial-and-error discover
			- Augments' primary gameplay purpose are to speed up player turns
				i.e. you don't spend 10 turns in a row just mashing attack
	




- Misc gameplay feature ideas
	- Some kind of benefit for completing turns quickly
		- The game *must* remain purely turn-based; this is non-negotiable.
			However, it would be cool to reward players who think quickly and
			take their turns fast, without punishing those who do not.
